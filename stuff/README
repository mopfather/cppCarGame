* WHAT IS TEXT RACER 
Text racer is a car racing game made in C++ for the programming course project 20/21.
The game is played in a windows console and everything in the game is drawn with ascii characters.

* INSTALLATION
To install the game compile the .cpp source files with any c++ compiler from the project folder.
The game relies on functions from the <windows.h> library and is not cross platform.
Ex: cd <textRacerFolder>
	g++ main.cpp Game.cpp Map.cpp -o "Text Racer"

* HOW TO PLAY
Launch the executable and you'll be greeted with the start screen, press any key to proceed to the game.
The game is point based, you can pick up bonuses (B) to gain points, hit obstances (X) to lose points, or
drive over specials (S) to clear every object on the screen.
There are enemy cars with random movement, avoid them or you will lose points.

Every 2000 points you proceed to the next level, where the game speed and amount of obstacles will increase.
If you go below the score threshold needed for your level you will go back to the previous level, with the map
in the same state (same player position, enemy car position and objects) as you left it.
The game ends when you go below 0 points or when you decide to quit.
